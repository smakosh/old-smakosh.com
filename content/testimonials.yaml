  review: Ismail is one of the most talented hardest working software engineers I've ever worked with. I've worked with him on several projects including JavaScript and React Native projects. Every time he's proven to be incredibly smart, hardworking and trustworthy. He writes beautiful, thoughtful code and isn't afraid to jump head first into technologies. He's even gone so far as to write his own CSS front end framework and hosted several conference talks
