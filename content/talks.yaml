- title: The Perceptron - Understanding the maths under the hood
  summary: During this talk, I covered a brief history about Ai, defined ML/DL & explained the difference between the two, started by recognizing an unknown type of flower from basic data we collected and how intuition managed to draw a line between the two types of flowers from our dataset, then I moved on to automate what we manually did and ended up making a Perceptron from scratch.

- title: Introducing Gatsby, the best SSG for React developers.
  summary: In this talk, I introduced Gatsby to developers, which is one of the three choices you'd consider when building a React app, it offers pre-rendering, has a huge community who have shipped many Gatsby plugins that help make the process easy, I discussed about what's so awesome about it, how it renders content & built a blog with markdown files in 5 minutes live coding with the attendees.

- title: Building static & dynamic apps with Gatsby
  summary: In this talk, I covered the same points I mentioned in my previous Gatsby talk as most of the attendees haven't any idea what Gatsby was, then I jumped into the dynamic Not Todo app I built during that morning which is connected to a REST API built quickly with express & mongoDB, I went through how to setup the routes using reach-router & how to use the "createPages" Gatsby API to create that page (since it's a SPA, there is only one page generated).
