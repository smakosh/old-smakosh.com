title: 'About me so far...'

I’m Ismail Ghallou also known as Smakosh, a nickname which was given to me since I was 8 years old by my friend’s dad, many told me that I was a good student when I was at primary school & thanks to video games and to my dad for buying our first pc ever & also some anime I was watching at that time, then I decided to get into a public schools rather than a private school on the last year of primary school, at that time I got addicted to Basketball though I was a good player, specially in the streets(and1), here’s a picture of some medals I got from some tournaments I & my friends won on Football & Basketball.

During secondary school I started exploring more hobbies like drawing, graffiti, biking & skateboarding and I was still getting good marks though, at high school I got addicted to Parkour & Free running and it was really a good experience “to not be able to do a backflip then after a long period of training (even though there were no gyms) to actually do it ” it was something really amazing, I spent like 2 years practicing and have recorded some videos right [here](https://www.instagram.com/smakosh19).

During the last year of high school I got a gaming pc which my dad bought for me since I asked a lot for it, specially for gaming & it made me get addicted to gaming and so I graduated from high school with bad marks but yeah I got accepted in some sort of school which is equivalent to university & at that moment everything has changed, I started teaching myself at home, learning, practicing by doing side projects & working as a free lancer from november 2015 until now, I taught myself Graphic, UI/UX design, programming & web development (front end & back end), restudied maths — algebra linear, calculus, probabilities... — & now i’m still learning specially about machine & deep learning specially neural networks & willing to create some web & mobile apps based on Artificial intelligence to help people.
